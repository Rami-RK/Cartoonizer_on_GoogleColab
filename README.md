## Cartoonizer_on_GoogleColab

### Cartoonizer_Deployment : Learning to Cartoonize Using White-box Cartoon Representations
#### Pretrained model and weights are used for this app development.
#### Dependencies are given in requirement.txt
#### The folder named "For Running Through GoogleColab" is contains files for replicating it on your system using googlecolab, streamlit and ngrok.
#### Just download the folder named "For Running Through GoogleColab", upload it on your google drive. Run the file named 'catoon_working_streamlit.ipynb' on your google colab, cell by cell. You can replicate it on your system very easily.Just take care about the path while mounting the google drive and using the path whrerever it is requiered.It will be changed based on where you put the files and folder in your google drive. 
#### * Reference: https://github.com/SystemErrorWang/White-box-Cartoonization.
#### * A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework is used to learn the extracted representations and to cartoonize images by creater in reference.They have used tensorflow 1.x for training and model development.
